I made a render to read the .obj file and sorted all the data respectively into vertices positions, indices and normals
using open gl to render the object heavily based off the example triangle.hpp that was supplied. To use it just type
in the location of the object you want to create and click load. If you wish to load a new one you need to unload
what is already there if there is something already loaded. You can click the print button to print to the console the
mesh data. You can also adjust the colour of the object using the h,s,v sliders.
