# 3D File Renderer
This was a program for my computer graphics course ( CGRA251 ) In this assignment I covered how 3D objects are defined and drawn onto a computer using openGL
This program reads a .obj file and reads through and renders the file on the screen using sliders to rotate and zoom on the object. This was a very
interesting challenge learning how a 3D object is rendered onto our 2 dimensional computer screens. This taught me the basics of 3D computer
graphics and the algorithm and file structures accompanied with them. As well as learning basics of openGL.
