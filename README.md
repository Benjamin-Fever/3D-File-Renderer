<h1>3D File Renderer</h1>
<p>
<h2>Description</h2>
This was a program for my computer graphics course ( CGRA251 ) In this assignment I covered how 3D objects are defined and drawn onto a computer using openGL
This program reads a .obj file and reads through and renders the file on the screen

<h4>What I Learnt</h4>
This was a very interesting challenge learning how a 3D object is rendered onto our 2 dimensional computer screens. This taught me the basics of 3D computer graphics and the algorithm and file structures accompanied with them. As well as learning basics of openGL.
